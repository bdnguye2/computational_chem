\section{Introduction}

Miniaturization of novel devices and machines on a molecular level
has been one of the main goals in electronics\cite{Vincenzo}. The decreasing
device size may lead to greater power and funcationality residing on
a chip. For instance, polycyclic aromatic carbons with curved $\pi$-conjugated
structures, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and buckybowls
are appealing materials due to their low density, structural stability,
and extended-delocalized $\pi$ networks that support mobile charge
carriers\cite{Laura}. However, few heteroatom-doped buckybowls
have been synthesized and reported. The most recent successful
synthesis of triazasumanene is an isoelectronic heteroanalogue
of sumanene from Tan et. al.\cite{doi:10.1246/bcsj.20170384}

First principle calculations may provide insights on the electronic
structures of these sumanene derivatives and improve upon the
current state-of-the-art. In this report, we provide a theoretical
investigation of the triazasumanene by computing the optimized
ground state and transition state structures with the corresponding
electronic circular dichroism (ECD).

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Statement of the Models}

A racemic mixture is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. In the synthesis
of triazasumanene, two absolute stereochemical configurations coexisist
which are designated as clockwise (C) and counterclockwise (A) as shown
in Fig \ref{fig:stereo}. The configuration is based on the heteroatoms
having the lowest possible number.

    enantiomers.}
  \label{fig:stereo}
\end{figure}

To resolve the racemic triazasumanene, one method is to use electronic
circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy coupled with electronic structure
calculations.

\subsection{Computational Details}

Within the TURBOMOLE v7.2 suite\ref{TURBOMOLE}, the aoforce module is used to compute
the vibrational frequencies and generate the ECD spectrum. The
triazasumanene structure was constructed on avogadro v1.2\ref{Hanwell2012}
and minimized with universal force field. This initial structure was fairly
planar and this iitial guess used to optimize with TPSS\ref{PhysRevLett.91.146401}.
